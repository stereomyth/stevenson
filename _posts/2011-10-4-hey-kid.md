Secreted away in a house in San Jose is a 7 strong team conversely ordained Supergiant. The latest in a prestigious lineage of miniature studios to demonstrate that incredible things are not just the realm of immense multitudes of flesh.

Bastion oozes a special kind of magic and charm only the focused nature of small teams can afford. Beautiful art and masterful prose forge Caelondia; a world so familiar yet always just behind the veil of the Calamity. 

As everything falls (literally) into place the constant narration anchors the world around you. Location as character has fascinated me ever since I first met Ankh-Morpork. As a testament to the world built by Kasavin and Supergiant; by the end of Bastion Caelondia felt like a long lost friend and I ached to restore itâ€™s original splendour.
