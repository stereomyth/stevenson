I realise this is not exactly current news, but I just found this image in my ‘sort’ folder and decided it was interesting enough to post nearly a year later. 

The Deepwater Horizon Event (aside from having an name pulled straight from Sci-fi) was …not …good. The inability to comprehend the gargantuan figures is a layer of bubble-wrap smothering the gut punch that was near infinite barrels of viscous death spewing into the Gulf of Mexico. There are many detailed details and statistical statistics out there but suffice to say it was bad.

Much protesting was heard, deservedly, as the crisis occurred. The protest above I found beautiful in its simplicity yet incredibly meaningful. Screen-printed with the very oil in question, gathered from a Louisiana beach, these posters by [Happiness Brussels](http://www.happiness-brussels.com/) truly create a message from the medium.
