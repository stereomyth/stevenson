> Since starting [The Fox is Black] over four years ago I have written by a particular forumla: One paragraph describing the topic, a second paragraph describing why I think it’s worth a damn. That’s it. It’s not rocket science, but it’s me trying. In fact, in my four years, I’ve written nearly 3,200 posts about topics that I think people should look at and trying to explain why you should give a damn.
