title: Reformat the Planet

2 Player Production’s début project Reformat the Planet is an energetic but insightful look into the origin of the now annual Blip Festival and the chiptune scene in general.

Better yet the film in its entirety is available to watch completely free of charge on Penny Arcade Television. If you want more and have the coins then a sexy DVD version is on sale from Fangamer including a directors cut and other extra extras.

Chiptune music has long been a favourite of mine and represents a kind of energy that nothing else can quite match, especially Anamanaguchi and Bitshifter.
