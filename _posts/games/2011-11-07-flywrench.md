Infinite lives, 2d perspective and a requisite for incredible precision are the hallmarks of the relatively new niche genre portmanteauically dubbed Masocore. Games like N+ and Super Meat Boy ask much of the player. Unlike the ‘failure equals loss of progression’ punishment of say a Demon’s Souls, Masocore respawns you moments from when you died. Infinite death and instant rebirth until you perfect that complex jump or otherwise destroy the controller.  

Flywrench is a perfect slice of masocore precision infuriation. A rather novel approach to 2d platforming you pilot a ship that must flap to stay afloat. Flapping and rolling; the ships two abilities will alter it’s colour allowing it to pass through similarly hued barriers. Touching anything of a different colour means instant dismemberment. Countering the necessity to stay aloft with barriers only traversable while not flapping creates a masterful balancing of progression and continued existence.

The minimal graphic style and radio-static music create a strange overall atmosphere, an unsettling feeling of intrusion. The graphics themselves make a screenshot almost unintelligible, the trailer does a somewhat better job. Or you know, the full game.
