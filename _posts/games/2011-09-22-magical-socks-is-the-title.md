After interrogating child molesters and dissecting subterranean abominations having to escape a magic sock seems about as disparate as physics could allow. 

Epic Yarn has a beautiful and incredibly well realised 2d universe of twine villains, fluff princes and cloth adventure. So beautiful in fact that I often found myself forgetting the Wiiâ€™s lack of 1080pness. 

There is no death and for the more casual player the game is fun to traverse. However seekers of challenge can optionally collect beads. Damage to Kirby will cause precious collectibles to burst forth making later levels increasingly difficult to master.
