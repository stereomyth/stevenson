In the running for the longest game title: "Penny Arcade Adventures: On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness - Episodes 1 & 2" (or PAA:OTRSPOD if you will) is an offensive and Lovecraftian semi turn-based RPG point and click adventure game from the “jpeg merchants” 
at [Penny Arcade](http://penny-arcade.com/) and “actually we’d rather do Deathspank” [Hothead](http://hotheadgames.com) Games.

Dark gods, murderous mimes and giant mechanised fruit rapists inhabit a world infused with the abusive genius of Penny Arcade. 
The combination of point and click exploration, [WRPG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game#Cultural_differences) dialogue trees 
and just-[JRPG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game#Cultural_differences)-enough turn-based combat runs a awesome balance that 
should be the standard for modern adventure games.

Through missfortune, madness and malady the final two episodes were struck from existance. Nevertheless like a ray of darkness in the otherwise impenetrable obsidian of the nether dark the final 2 chapters are materialising in [retro JRPG](http://www.penny-arcade.com/rainslick/) form.

Created by [Zeboyd Games](http://zeboyd.com) they are certainly a change but still fantastic for those who are fond of ancient graphics and turn based roleplaying.
