Fear, it would seem often arises from vulnerability. Videogames, so often tools of empowerment, tend to struggle with this. Dead Space may be an incredible game but when armed with projecting devices of precision flesh separation can you ever really be afraid?

Amnesia: The Dark Descent masterfully provides you with little but light. A simple oil lamp with diminishing supplies and a scattered collection of tinder-boxes for lighting candles. This light is not the magical video game kind either; it has no demon banishing properties. This one token that keeps you this side of madness conversely attracts the deformed grotesqueries that seek so fervently the removal of your precious organs. 

Being chased down a semi-flooded corridor by an invisible horror that wrenches doors agape as it hunts you. The game deftly recaptures the helplessness and fear of the unknown that had me terrified of Forbidden Planet so long ago.
