Alice’s Adventure in Wonderland is one of those influential and often overused modern legend that seemingly everyone knows. Sitting among the pantheon of comic book heroes and famous literary characters that constitute our modern mythologies. Alice has been adapted and reused almost as many times as Spiderman or Dracula. The American McGee games have the interesting spin that the fractured heroine only believes she is the eponymous Alice after her family perish in a house fire.

Wonderland may be a dark place inhabited by slime draped doll-limb aberrations, but the London of this cannon is all the more sinister. Without the knowledge of the recommended age rating I was quite surprised by the use of language; having never been called a cum-bucket by a game before. This unexpected ferociousness, especially for something spawned from a children’s book, helped to enhance the unease conveyed by the “real” world.

Also I love the fact that [Spicy Horse's](http://www.spicyhorse.com/) iPhone development child studio has the logically perfect name Spicy Pony.
