To me noire is black and white. Even when reading fiction or listening to audio drama the angry heros stalk about hue-less worlds amid a high-contrast downpour. It’s part of the appeal for me; a world much like our own but foreign and removed even down to the particles of light.   

Tucked away in the felicitous pause menu of LA Noire is the option to experience the game solely in monochrome. In the quest for ever more beautiful and realistic graphics this may seem like a step in a strange direction. Clearly this is the reason it is not default. Personally I immediately enabled this removal of colour and didn’t look back.

The lack of nonsensical amounts of rain was however, somewhat disappointing.
