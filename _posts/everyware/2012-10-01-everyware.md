Humans love things; things are everywhere. Objects surround, define and enhance us. Forming tools from the material we discovered strewn about was the tuning point that proved humans had greater potential. The Internet of Things is the concept of imbuing objects with an interconnectedness that can improve and even redefine.

> Ideas and information are important, but things matter much more. - *Kevin Ashton*

As media is becoming increasingly digital many of us are struggling with the leaps of logic or even fighting against them. The sense of ownership over an object is difficult to transfer to the intangible nature of digital media. It's easy to love an album and that association is easily transferred to a cd or vinyl but is much harder to apply to immaterial data.
