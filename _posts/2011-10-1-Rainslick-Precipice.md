title : Penny Arcade Adventures: On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness - Episode 1 & 2
category : ephemera
---
In the running for the longest game title PAA:OTRSPOD is an offensive and Lovecraftian semi turn-based RPG point and click adventure game from the “jpeg merchants” at [Penny Arcade](http://penny-arcade.com/) and “actually we’d rather do Deathspank” [Hothead](http://hotheadgames.com) Games.

Dark gods, murderous mimes and giant mechanised fruit rapists inhabit a world infused with the abusive genius of Penny Arcade. The combination of point and click exploration, [WRPG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game#Cultural_differences) dialogue trees and just-JRPG-enough turn-based combat runs a awesome balance that should be the standard for modern adventure games.

Unfortunately inadequate sales of episode 2 and Hothead starting Deathspank caused episodes 3 and 4 to be cancelled. Disappointingly even Ep2 seems to have been affected, Mike’s drawings are increasingly replaced by some single line width equipped impersonator (I could tell by the pixels).

The ray of darkness in the otherwise impenetrable obsidian of the nether dark is that the final 2 chapters are materialising in textual form. While the writing is only a part of what made these games, it’s still fantastic for those who are fond of words. Also Tycho’s middle name is Ephemerous.
