For the last 14 years Jerry holkins and Mike Krahulik have written and drawn [Penny Arcade](http://penny-arcade.com), a webcomic which they upload to their website for free thrice weekly. Despite giving their main product away for free they have grown immensely over the life of their business. Fantasticaly they still make the comics they are known for; they now have over 3.5 millon readers and 3 top-selling videogames based on their comics. On top of the comic they have foundeded a global charity that raises millions of dollars to buy toys for childrens hospitals and also run one of the worlds largest gaming conventions.

They are an inspiring example of people doing exactly what they love as a job. At the same time though they are using thier fame to help sick children and create huge social events enjoyed by thousands of people every year.
